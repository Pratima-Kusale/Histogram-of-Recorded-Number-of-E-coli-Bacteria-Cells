# Histogram-of-Recorded-Number-of-E-coli-Bacteria-Cells
Lineage sequence of multiple frames of e coli-bacteria modeled under the following differential equation
model. x-denotes the minutes (time) and equation model y-represents number of E-coli bacteria cells.
Initial condition of the model is y(0)=1

After solving the above differential equation solution, the data of number of E-coli bacteria cells (y) is
recorded and tabulated for different time instance of minutes (x) x=1,2,6,7,8,9,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,21,22
(minutes x).

Python programming is executed for data visualization of Histogram representation of recorded number
of E-coli bacteria cells particular distribution in the bin, is considered in choice of Strungeâ€™s Rule. Data
Visualization of Histogram distribution is plotted in the relative frequency.
